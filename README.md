## Hello World - Summery

- We can use a `<script>` tag to add javascript code to a page.
- The type and language attribute not required.
- A script in an external file can be inserted with `<script src="./path/app.js"> </script>`.

## Code Structure - Summery
```
alert('Tusar')
alert('Rakibul Islam')
```
> Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as a 'implicit' semicolon, this is called and automated semicolon insertion.

```
alert("Hello")
[1, 2].forEach(alert);
```
> That's because javascript does not assume a before square brackets `[]` So the code is the last example is treated as a single statement. 

## Variable - Summery

> We can declare variables to store data by using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

- `let` -- is a modern variable declaration.
- `var` -- is an old-school variable declaration.
- `const` -- is like `let`, but the value of the variable can not be changed
